Hey this is a web-scraping example.
first it takes an input of the name of the product you are looking for.
it searches for the second hand prices of product on olx.
then, based on the products available on olx it finds the most relevant products listed on amazon and flipkart(there's a bug in the flipkart  code rn)
in the end it provides you with a data structure which has the name and price of the product on olx, the name and the price of the most relevant-
product on amazon and the name and price of the most relevant product on flipkart.
the data is stored in nested dictionaries.
